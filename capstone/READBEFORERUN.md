# Important

## Username & Password

### My personal login to vtmapp (Start here)
* Username : **leo@mobilelocker.com**
* Password : **test12345**


### My employer's login to vtmapp (If you'd like to see how other accounts work)
* Username : **mark@mobilelocker.com**
* Password : **test12345**

## Optional
* I decided to include both mine and my employer's accounts to show the difference in videos, and show the communication with the backend differentiating the two users and their respective assets.
* I included the authentication info in this document as to not share it on the repository, however the app was previously setup to prefill this single username and password, so if you navigate to lines 11-12 on *LoginView.swift* you will find string fields where the username and password would have went in the repo.
